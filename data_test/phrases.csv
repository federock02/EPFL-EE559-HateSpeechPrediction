I canâ€™t believe those, 0.4
When I see those people I always think, 0.4
Every time someone from, 0.3
They think they have the right, 0.3
I hate when a Chinese, 0.5
Yesterday I saw a black, 0.3
This morning I took a cup, 0
Every time I see one of those, 0.2
As soon as they came into, 0.2
Right after my birthday, 0
"Before I knew it, I was robbed by", 0.4
The sun peeked through the curtains this morning, 0
I poured a cup of coffee and sat by the window., 0
The cat curled up on the warm laptop keyboard., 0
